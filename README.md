Current Progress 7/21:
Currently I have started programming the UniSolder with a PICKit 3. Plugging it in while powered resulted
in the PICKit sucessfully connecting yet the Device not fully working together, with a warning about too
much current on the VDD. I'll need to review what has gone on in the fourms to see if theres a potential
fix for this.
