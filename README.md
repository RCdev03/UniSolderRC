## Motivation & Setup
As an Electrical Engineering Student I currently have a cheap amazon solderin iron that doesn't offer much
control in terms of temperature, iron types, and some nice quality of life devices such as put the iron 
into standby a sleep mode to limit the power being used, and more. 

I Spec'd out this version to work with the JBC T210 Iron and a C210024 cartrigde. Although I plan to get
a few more different cartridges, and irons such as the JBC nano tweezers.


## Current Progress 7/21:
Currently I have started programming the UniSolder with a PICKit 3. Plugging it in while powered resulted
in the PICKit sucessfully connecting yet the Device not fully working together, with a warning about too
much current on the VDD. I'll need to review what has gone on in the fourms to see if theres a potential
fix for this.
